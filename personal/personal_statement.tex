\section*{Personal Background}

\begin{singlespace}
Human beings do not receive scalar reward signals for complex behaviors
such as votes in elections.  Even the taste of food is a secondary value
signal, modulated by and acting as a prediction of later glycemic
satiation.  Current machine-learning models remain far below human level
in most action-oriented tasks, exactly because they require immediate,
scalar reward signals, and cannot make use of multivariate dependencies
to guide action\cite{Lake2016}. How can we build machines which learn
to act as fluently as people, according to human-like goals and
reasons\cite{Lake2016,Railton2017}? By pursuing a PhD and subsequent
research career, I am eager to blend the cognitive sciences with
computation in investigating how machines, including ``meat machines''
like us, can feel, evaluate, reason socially, and pursue goals.

Northeastern's Lisa Feldman Barrett has convened an interdisciplinary group
of Psychologists, Engineers, and Neuroscientists to model the predictive
brain and its application to the theory of constructed emotion\cite{Barrett2015,BarrettTheoryOfConstructed2017}.
The group brings together a largely female group from the Psychology
department with largely male staff from the Engineering and Computer
Science fields.  My work will connect these two by building computational
models for the ``pure'' psychologists and neuroscientists, training them
in the application of Bayesian analyses and tools to their work, and
learning the science of emotion from them in return.

I also look forward to mentoring co-op students recruited by my primary
adviser Jan-Willem van de Meent from Bunker Hill Community College, a
predominantly female, African American, and Hispanic institution which also
serves many nontraditional students.  Diversifying our work in statistics
and neuroscience will be a joy and an honor.
