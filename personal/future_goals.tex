In conclusion, I believe that by taking everyday emotion and action
seriously, we can further investigate the computational basis of
motivated behavior and emotional health in the brain.  My PhD with the
Psychologists, Engineers, and Neuroscientists group will provide the
training necessary to launch my research program, as well as a diverse
and supportive community of interdisciplinary peers.  In my subsequent
career, I plan to continue investigating the nature of affect and action
in academia, in a cognitive science, neuroscience, or computing position.
While we todya remain uncertain of how voters' brains choose, I hope to
support the point of view that ``neat'' principles couple to embodiment
to give rise to the continua of perceiving, feeling, reasoning, and
acting.  Accomplishing this will provide plenty of ``reward'' in my
future.
