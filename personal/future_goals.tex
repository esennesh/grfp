\section*{Future Goals}

\begin{singlespace}

In conclusion, I believe that\textemdash with additional experiments
and a keen eye towards taking everyday action seriously\textemdash we
can further investigate the computational basis of motivated action.
For myself, a PhD will provide the training necessary to accomplish
my goals, as well as a supportive community of like-minded peers.
In my subsequent career, I hope to continue investigating the nature
of intention and action in an interdisciplinary computing and psychology
program. While we today remain uncertain how voters\textquoteright{}
brains choose, I hope to eventually support the point of view that
``neat'' principles give rise to the continua of perceiving, feeling,
reasoning, and acting. Accomplishing just this will provide plenty
of ``reward'' in my future.
