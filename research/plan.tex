I will begin my work by expanding active inference into a full-blown framework
for variational Bayesian learning in action tasks similar to the OpenAI
Gym ``DOOM'' task used by Cullen and colleagues\cite{Cullen2018}.  From
there, my main work will consist of modeling the ``body budgeting'' problem
by alternating between computational theorizing using flow networks, and
psychological/neuroscientific experiments to empirically examine what sort
of dynamic flow network can account for human visceromotor and interoceptive
capabilities.  This would be one of the first initiatives to model not only
a single supply-demand process in the brain, but a theory of allostasis
completely distinct from homeostatic feedback control\cite{Sterling2012,Sterling2015,Christie2015}.

Beyond just modeling allostasis in the central nervous system, scaling
up active inference will allow us to specify the goals for robotics and AI
control tasks as composeable probabilistic programs

I will be conducting my research as part of the Psychologists, Engineers,
and Neuroscientists Group (PEN) convened by Lisa Feldman Barrett to model
the predictive brain and the theory of constructed emotion\cite{Barrett2015,BarrettTheoryOfConstructed2017}.
As part of this colloboration, I am being co-advised by both Jan-Willem van
de Meent, an expert in probabilistic programming, and Professor Barrett as
part of her Interdisciplinary Affective Science Lab.  Since the Lab performs
both purely investigative and clinical research, I will be able to test my
models of allostasis and core affect against clinical data, and apply it
clinically.  Dysfunctional interoceptive inference and visceromotor planning
are implicated in many of today's most pressing health issues: depression,
addiction, and obesity can all arise from malfunctions in the brain's core
allostatic and interoceptive mechanisms that construct affect\cite{Stephan2016}.
